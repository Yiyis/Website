              <p>
                Mai is an interactive art installation focusing on the theme of
                the environmental issue particularly air pollution in China. The
                visualization in Mai is inspired by traditional Chinese
                watercolour and projected onto a bamboo canvas showing the daily
                average of air pollution index between 2012 to 2015 in Shanghai.
                There were a lantern and a bottle of the plant placed in front
                of the visualization, which corresponding with the audience's
                touch and distance to the installation with sound and light.
                Past data of air pollution is not a waste that people will
                gradually forget but can be changed into things of value and
                aesthetical and hopefully help to raise awareness of
                environmental protection.
              </p>
              <h3>Objective</h3>
              <p>
                PM2.5 is believed to be the main pollution causing the haze
                problem. Particles lower than or equal to 10 micrometers in
                diameter are so small that they can invade the lungs and
                potentially cause serious health problems. Ten micrometers is
                smaller than the width of a strand of human hair. Coarse dust
                particles (PM10) are 2.5 to 10 micrometers in diameter. When
                PM2.5 becomes higher on a particular day, the ink in the
                painting will become darker and mountains from distances will
                transform into shadows resembling smokes. When Pm2.5 lowers on a
                particular day, the ink will become lighter.I am trying to raise
                awareness of environmental protection by creating an aesthetic
                and interactive artwork through this art installation.

                The mental pain comes from political covering and can be eased
                though psychological adjustment to transform people’s thinking
                or with a blind eye to the way of ostrich to escape. However if
                the environment issues hails from a political covering, not only
                is it a torture of human’s body but also the spirit. Because
                this is an infringement of human rights, denying the basic
                requirement of allowing a human to consume fresh air, for the
                well-being of their body while living under the jurisdiction of
                their trusted government, whom they paid taxes to and pledge
                their loyalty to the nation. Even the government still chose to
                prohibit some artists or media, “Haze Art” as a trend is
                gradually helping to raise public awareness these years. People
                begin to realize the serious problem of the environment. Only
                when the awareness of mass has been raised, the government will
                be forced to bow to public pressure and reform the energy
                structure and eventually solve the problem in the future.

                In-lieu with a fusion of Chinese calligraphy and arts, the ink
                resembles smog and polluted air that created with scanner and
                Photoshop. By visualizing particle matter in the air from 2012
                in Shanghai, I want to show how smog influenced the environment
                in China. The visualization is a scene I composed in Unity3D
                that looping the XML data.
