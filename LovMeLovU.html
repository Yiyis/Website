      <h1>LovMeLovU</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    LuvMeLuvU is a set of two smart pillows designed for long distance relationship. They can detect and send the userâ€™s missing to their caring one in any corner of the world. The progress bar on the pillows can let them know how much they currently miss each other. When both of the users are in the same Missing Level, synced vibrations from two pillows will get closer to their hearts.
The luvMeLuvU pillows incorporated Particle Photon, touch sensing with conductive threads, 3D printing and other digital components. This project is trying to present the idea of calm technology and also finding a way to embed rigid hardware in a soft and ubiquitous object in daily life.
