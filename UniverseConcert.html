          This is a multi-sensory performance which took place at the Immersive
          Vision Theatre (Dome). People are invited to use their mobile phone to
          interact with the dome theatre by turning into a star in the universe.
          After entering the URL, the audiences can control their own star and
          make a unique beautiful sound, which will eventually become a concert.
          At the same time, raspberry rum jelly shots were served to make the
          multisensory experience because scientific research shows that the
          center of Milky Way smells like raspberry and taste like rum.
