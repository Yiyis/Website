–Intro
It’s a multi-sensory performance I worked with Sam Wray (also known as 2xAA) which took place at the Immersive Vision Theatre (Dome). People are invited to use their mobile phone to interact with the dome by becoming a star in the universe. After entering the URL, everyone can control their own star and make a beautiful sound, it has eventually become a concert. At the same time, raspberry rum jelly shots were served to make the multisensory experience as the center of Milky Way smells like raspberry and taste like rum.</p>
