                A experimental research project at
                <a href="http://socialbodylab.com" class="alert-link"
                  >Social Body Lab</a
                >. Sleepers are designed to keep the user from staying up too
                late. It will send messages of “It’s time to go to bed”
                continuously to the user after a preset time. Only when the user
                goes to the bed and not wearing Sleepers, the user’s phone will
                stop getting those messages.

              <h2>Objective</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Aesthetic: Aesthetic is the main goal of Sleepers, we try to
                  find a way to combine digital components into soft fabrics.
                  The appearance of sleepers wouldn’t remind any of the
                  electronics at the first impression as they are seamlessly
                  embedded within the interlayer of the fabrics. Sleepers are
                  minimalist design with just two pieces of white felts.
                  Geometric flower patterns are designed to go with the led on
                  particle photon on the top, to show if the slippers are online
                  and functional.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Comfort: Comfort is also another main goal when designing
                  Sleepers as slippers themselves are supposed to be cozy when
                  wearing at home, so comfortability and lightweight are the
                  crucial elements. As the fact that human feet are very
                  sensitive especially most people like to wear slippers with
                  bare feet so we developed the layering technique to work with
                  the rigid digital components.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Easy to use: Sleepers are very easy to use, the functionality
                  is very simple just to focusing on whether it has been worn.
                  The user can plug in the mini USB cable to charge the battery
                  when it’s out of power.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, there are some limitations and future improvements for
                the Sleepers. The first one is the improvement for the position
                of charging port, either to find a way to extend the mini USB
                port or add an external led to replacing the onboard RGB status
                LED. The second one is the improvement of the power switch, it
                should be less electrical appearance.
