              <p>THE PROBLEMS WE FACED:</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                1. Design an ending for reading the data. Since we currently
                using a manually json data which only contain 2~3 hours flight
                datas, we decide a ending for reading the data which will let us
                and the audience know “here is the ending of the datas.” Using
                the below function to know the length of the data array. This
                callback function will only run at the first time the json file
                be read.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Read the json from server. Our original plan was putting the
                json file in webspace server. However, on the day we did the
                final testing, the server we used was block for some system
                maintain issues( not sure ). Then we decided to create a js file
                (DATA.js) to storage all the json datas.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Send Data: It’s time to connect p5.js to arduino, we used a
                bridge called p5.serialcontrol to send data to serial port so
                arduino can read it and write to relevant pins. At the
                beginning, p5.js just read from the json file and send outbyte
                to serial port. We sense that will give us trouble so we simply
                compared the data within p5.js and directly send four numbers to
                arduino. We tested it when reading json file that been put on
                webspace, which works perfectly fine.
              </p>
              <p>
                But after we decided to work on local data file we faced some
                weird problems. When reconnecting the p5.js to arduino, suddenly
                it’s just not working. We spent a whole afternoon
                troubleshooting. Initially we thought it’s the problem from
                p5.js after we wrote some new code to read Data.js as arrays, so
                we console log out all the number and data types and found there
                shouldn’t be an issue. Then we commented out all the data but
                just sent a simple “1” to the serial port in the draw function,
                interestingly arduino couldn't even read that simple command. So
                we found an example code from p5.serialcontrol that we know
                which will definitely work to test with arduino. And…. it works.
                So we replaced both the arduino code and p5.js code to test with
                ours to see which part is causing problem. Then we found that
                probably the differences between digitalwrite and analogwrite in
                arduino, which obviously make no sense. However, it did only
                work in analogwrite for some reason. We re-started our laptop
                and took a deep breath and hope everything become normal. And…
                it still doesn’t work. Another one hour past, here we come the
                magical moment, we used another usb cable for arduino board,
                everything turned out to work! Hallelujah! What a typical day to
                dealing with digital components.
