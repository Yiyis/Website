        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Mai is an interactive art installation focusing on the theme of the
          environmental issue particularly air pollution in China. The
          visualization in Mai is inspired by traditional Chinese watercolour
          and projected onto a bamboo canvas showing the daily average of air
          pollution index between 2012 to 2015 in Shanghai. There were a lantern
          and a bottle of the plant placed in front of the visualization, which
          corresponding with the audience's touch and distance to the
          installation with sound and light. Past data of air pollution is not a
          waste that people will gradually forget but can be changed into things
          of value and aesthetical and hopefully help to raise awareness of
          environmental protection.
        </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          PM2.5 is believed to be the main pollution causing the haze problem.
          Particles lower than or equal to 10 micrometers in diameter are so
          small that they can invade the lungs and potentially cause serious
          health problems. Ten micrometers is smaller than the width of a strand
          of human hair. Coarse dust particles (PM10) are 2.5 to 10 micrometers
          in diameter. When PM2.5 becomes higher on a particular day, the ink in
          the painting will become darker and mountains from distances will
          transform into shadows resembling smokes. When Pm2.5 lowers on a
          particular day, the ink will become lighter.I am trying to raise
          awareness of environmental protection by creating an aesthetic and
          interactive artwork through this art installation.

          The mental pain comes from political covering and can be eased though
          psychological adjustment to transform people’s thinking or with a
          blind eye to the way of ostrich to escape. However if the environment
          issues hails from a political covering, not only is it a torture of
          human’s body but also the spirit. Because this is an infringement of
          human rights, denying the basic requirement of allowing a human to
          consume fresh air, for the well-being of their body while living under
          the jurisdiction of their trusted government, whom they paid taxes to
          and pledge their loyalty to the nation. Even the government still
          chose to prohibit some artists or media, “Haze Art” as a trend is
          gradually helping to raise public awareness these years. People begin
          to realize the serious problem of the environment. Only when the
          awareness of mass has been raised, the government will be forced to
          bow to public pressure and reform the energy structure and eventually
          solve the problem in the future.

        <p>
          In-lieu with a fusion of Chinese calligraphy and arts, the ink
          resembles smog and polluted air that created with scanner and
          Photoshop. By visualizing particle matter in the air from 2012 in
          Shanghai, I want to show how smog influenced the environment in China.
          The visualization is a scene I composed in Unity3D that looping the
          XML data.

          The lantern and a bottle of plant filled with water are controlled by
          Arduino that having serial communications with Unity3D.
