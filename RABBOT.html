          This thesis project explores the possibilities of generating shared
          awareness in a virtual reality (VR) experience between a head-mounted
          display (HMD) wearer and other observers in the same physical space by
          merging wearable technology, augmented reality, asymmetric game design
          and wireless communications in the internet of things (IoT). The final
          outcome of this thesis project, RABBOT, features a modified VR
          head-mounted display and three-player asymmetric mobile game
          experiences with an embedded communication system to create
          opportunities for shared awareness amongst players. In the game, the
          participating observers can play cooperatively as Scientists to
          against the HMD wearer who is playing the Rabbot. Overall this thesis
          project argues that an engaging VR experience should not focus
          exclusively on the HMD wearer but also include other audiences to
          address and engage the relationships and interactions between them.

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The isolating design of virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays
          (HMD) is typical in the single-player experience - immersing one into
          a virtual environment. This often creates a situation in which only
          one headset is available but no opportunities for engagement are made
          accessible for other people nearby. This isolation in VR cuts off
          social connections and awareness between the virtual world and
          physical world, between the HMD wearers and other observers.
          Additionally, the current offerings in the consumer electronics market
          of the head-mounted display have a dull appearance, which also shows
          the lack of attention in terms of design for other audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          This thesis is designed to address this problem and to explore the
          possibilities of generating shared awareness in a VR experience
          between the HMD wearer and other observers in the same physical space
          by merging wearable technology, augmented reality, asymmetric game
          design and wireless communications in the Internet of Things (IoT).
          The principal objective of my thesis project is to argue that an
          engaging VR experience need not solely focus on the HMD wearer but
          also other third-party audiences, whether these are participating
          observers or ambient observers.
