      <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    In this cyber-fantasy setting, trying to make your way to Sanctuary is hard enough as it is, but for Daughter, it’s even harder after Mother gets hurt. Daughter has to learn how to take responsibility and fast, before Mother fades to dust! Navigate through different zones, help the Locals, and defeat the Final Boss in a top-down, action rpg, coming of age story. Your decisions along the way will affect your skills, so make sure to choose wisely!

      <p>
      Mother: Capable, brave, strong and reliable. Mother is a veteran in the post-apocalyptic world and has made it her priority to make sure Daughter is safe. She may have sheltered her too much, which she comes to regret after her injury. </p>

      <p>
        The Boss: The final boss of the game. An old guardian of Sanctuary who’s programming has been corrupted. It takes the protection of Sanctuary a little too seriously. It is the final obstacle for Mother and Daughter to get through.

      <p>
        The Locals: These creatures are unique to each zone and can be pacified by puzzle solving. If you decide to do a combat route instead, these Locals are your primary enemy.

      <p>
        The Frog: The frogs are your friends. They will teach you a new skill. Frogs are very good at jumping, and they can teach you how to do that easily, as long as you complete the puzzle
