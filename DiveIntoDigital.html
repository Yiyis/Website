        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Data visualization of Google search trends in Virtual Reality which
          focuses on the mobile brands from 2011 until now.

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          In the name of fast paced digital technology brands such as Motorolla,
          Nokia, etc. birth and die and new brands appear like the iPhone.
          Hashtags birth and die such as #MannequinChallenge #IceBucketChallenge
          and #HarlemShake. New words emmerge such as “Unlike”, “Unfriend” “WTF”
          and “OMG” etc.. and they even go out of the digital ream to get used
          in real life communication and conversation and even take place in
          international dictionaries and shape languages. As Digital futures
          enthusiasts we have a huge interest in the past of the digital media
          and technology and how it evolved through the years. Google today is
          the most used search engines in the world and google analytics is a
          great source to have as accurate data as possible about different
          trends and mentions from any past till this date. Google as a platform
          operates 1.2 trillion searches per year, which means 3.5 billion
          searches PER DAY. Digital technologies such as the floppy disk which
          was greatly used in the 90s and early 2000s is no longer existant, it
          was replaced by other technologies such as the CD ROM, the DVD ROM,
          the usb flash drive, the external hard drive and today the Cloud! Even
          though a millennial can search today what a floppy disk means, the
          current used technology will be by far the one known and searched or
          mentioned on google today hence our choice and interest to go with
          Google trends as a data source. With the emergence and use of Big Data
          and 5G the world is looking a new challenge: storage! In the 90s
          floppy disk was one of the most used disks for data storage and it was
          only 3.5 MB, todays that seems insane and extremely unuseful. We aim
          to visualize the billions of mentions of this word relatively to other
          relevant storages today such as the Hard drive and the cloud storage.
          Technicalities: To be able to visualize these tremendous amounts of
          mentions we needed to scope them down to percentages to visualize them
          in relativity to each other. In order to give the user/viewer a
          feeling of the “Sea” of mentions and this endless digital world of
          words and digits we aim to transport the human from the physical space
          to a digital virtual one using virtual reality. The words or mentions
          will be flying around the user with a rotating dial at the feet level
          that spins as the months and years pass by to make it an experience of
          2 minutes or so. Using scenario: Mainly used as an art piece in art
          gallery or public space Tool for SEO (Search engine optimization) We
          are in process to seeking some potential to work with google like a
          workshop in summer?

          In the class we tried to find some interesting datas source. Below is
          some data sources we found in class.

            </li>
            <li>
              OpenSNP Tons of data free for download, including many actual
              23AndMe data sets. This is where I got my data on how much
              research has been done for any given SNP. The OpenSNP ranking is
              based on entries in the SNPedia, papers published in PLoS and
              Genome.gov, annotations in the Personal Genome Project and papers
              on Mendeley.
            </li>
            <li>
              SNPedia — This is an open wiki for SNP associations. It has an
              enormous amount of information on specific SNPs, the different
              variations and their associations with phenotypes and medical
              conditions. It doesn’t have the raw data files available through
              OpenSNP, but it has far more detail on the associations of
              individual SNPs.

          PIXELS (iMAC) We are stuck with the visualization of stars dying and
          birthing in a more effective way instead of just fading in and out, we
          are also not sure about fit this huge amount numbers in the platform
          that we are working on, so we take this idea as a plan B and coming up
          with a new idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Final idea - Visualize the keyword that people put in google search
          engine per minute, themes we have in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Political parties in US</li>

          Google now processes over 40,000 search queries every second on
          average (visualize them here), which translates to over 3.5 billion
          searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide. How
          many google searched today:

          Firstly we export the .csv file to .xml file which contains correct
          tags of each types of data that can be load from Unity3D through xml
          function. And then Unity get the data as String which can be used as
          variables to assign to game objects. For this project, we used
          particle systems to generate the visualization as our base data is
          numerous. We import GoogleVR package(V1.11) into unity to build the VR
          environment. It’s running perfectly in Unity but after building out to
          iPhone, the XML file has been baked to another format with different
          path. After a lot of research and debugging, we finally found a
          solution to solve this problem after reading a post here:

        <p><b>Feedback and The Future: </b></p>
        <p>
          We were able to achieve many of the goals we set out to early on in
          the process; we incorporated a space filled with overwhelming amount
          of words or mentions around the user and created an immersed
          environment. In potential future interactions we would like to both
          refine and expand on the work completed here based off of class
          discussion and different feedback we received throughout the process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Immersion of the user in data can take one step back from how we
            presented the data. It could be a good pay-off to combine in the
            visualization how the binary system of a computer works and place
            the user inside that virtual environment to simulate the process of
            how computer process data. In this way, audience can “see” the data
            from where it is generated.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the version of the prototype that we presented in class we
            studied the amount of mentions related to storage in particular, but
            as mentioned in the feedback comments, the topic can be anything
            really. From hashtags used thousands and thousands of times to
            different brands or technologies searched so many times over the
            years.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also in our version, we only presented three mentions because of the
            limits of using unity building the VR environment. The more mentions
            used the bigger number of cameras needed in Unity to render a good
            visualization requiring a lot of space and a very powerful computer.
            In order to import more different data, we can try to move
            everything to another development engine, such as Unreal, which may
            provide better support for VR environment.
