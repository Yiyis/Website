      <h1>EmoLace</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Ever wonder what other people are feeling right now?
Emolace is a fashion accessory reading emotional tweets from all over the world. It changes colors depending on different hashtags used. By tracking the sharing of the hashtags: #happy #sad #ew #scared and #mad, Emolace tells the current emotion of the ever-updating internet. The speed of blinking is based on the strength of WiFi signal, which represents how well as an individual is connected to the cyber world.
Emolace incorporates Particle Photon with IFTTT and powered by three AA batteries. It is comfortable to wear and can be turned on /off by a switch on the back. Its unisex design goes equally well with a broad range of outfits.
